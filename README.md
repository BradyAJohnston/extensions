# extension
My own personal repo for distributing Blender extensions, for potential testing and bug fixing.

This is an experiment in self-hosting a Blender extensions repo, using the released assets from different GitHub repos as the download files. 

Assets are sourced from repos listed in [source.txt](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/extensions/blob/main/repo/source.txt)

Rebuilt by GHA on every push. 

Downloads are currently slow inside of Blender because GH might rate-limit without a token.
