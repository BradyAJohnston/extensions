This is an experiment in self-hosting a Blender extensions repo, using the released assets from different GitHub repos as the download files. 

Assets are sourced from repos listed in [source.txt](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/extensions/blob/main/repo/source.txt)

You can add this repo with the following url:
```bash
https://bradyajohnston.github.io/extensions/index.json
```
